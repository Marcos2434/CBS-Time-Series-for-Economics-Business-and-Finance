    "\n",
    "The ACF does not provide a clear rule for detection of AR processes. The reason behind it is that indirect autocorrelations are present in ACF of any autoregressive\n",
    "process: i.e. in an AR(1) there is a correlation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, notice that the partial autocorrelation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-s}$ eliminates the\n",
    "effects of the intervening values $y_{t-1}$ through $y_{t-s+1}$. Therefore in an\n",
    "AR(1) process PAC of order 2 is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, PACF provides a convenient rule for detection of a pure\n",
    "AR process: its order is the largest k for which the partial\n",
    "autocorrelation is different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an invertible MA process, the PACF will measure the autocorrelations in the AR$(\\infty)$ process that corresponds to that process. Hence the slow decay towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway: ACF can help us detect the order of a MA process, the last significant lag of ACF function is the suggested lag of MA process.**\n",
