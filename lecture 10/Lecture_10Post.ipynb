    "<h2>Solution to Exercise 1</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Define weak stationarity.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Weak stationarity, or second-order stationarity, means that a time series has a constant mean, a constant variance, and an autocovariance that depends only on the lag, not on time.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the difference between weak and strict stationarity.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Strict stationarity requires that the entire distribution of a series is time-invariant, while weak stationarity only requires constancy of the mean, variance, and autocovariance function. Therefore, strict stationarity is a stronger condition than weak stationarity.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the difference between stationary and trend-stationary data.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Stationary data fluctuate around a constant mean without trends, whereas trend-stationary data have a deterministic trend (e.g., linear) that can be removed to make the series stationary.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the shape of the ACF and PACF of an AR(3) process.</strong><br>\n",
    "  For an AR(3) process, the PACF cuts off after lag 3, while the ACF decays gradually over time. The specific shape of the ACF depends on the model coefficients.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the shape of the ACF and PACF of an MA(5) process.</strong><br>\n",
    "  In an MA(5) process, the ACF cuts off after lag 5, while the PACF decays gradually without a clear cutoff, reflecting the finite moving average structure.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss how information criteria can be used to determine the best model.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Information criteria like AIC and BIC balance model fit and complexity, with lower values indicating better models. Generally, AIC favors more complex models, while BIC penalizes complexity more heavily.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the iterative procedure of eliminating insignificant coefficients.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Start with a full model, then iteratively remove statistically insignificant coefficients based on p-values until only significant terms remain, refining the model’s simplicity without losing predictive accuracy.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the recursive pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting procedure.</strong><br>\n",
    "  This involves generating forecasts for data points excluded from estimation, computing forecast errors, and comparing models based on their out-of-sample performance over multiple iterations.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the difference between AR and MA models.</strong><br>\n",
    "  AR models express the current value as a function of past values, while MA models represent it as a function of past shocks. AR models have a gradually decaying PACF, whereas MA models have a sharp ACF cutoff.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the difference between ADL and VAR models.</strong><br>\n",
    "  ADL models include external predictors in a univariate framework, whereas VAR models are multivariate, modeling each variable as a function of its own lags and the lags of all other variables.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the concept of Granger causality.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Granger causality tests whether past values of one variable contain information that helps predict another variable beyond what is explained by its own past values.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the difference between DF and ADF tests.</strong><br>\n",
    "  The DF test checks for a unit root without lagged differenced terms, while the ADF test includes them to control for autocorrelation, providing a more robust test for unit roots.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Discuss the difference between the Engle–Granger and Phillips–Ouliaris tests for cointegration.</strong><br>\n",
    "  The Engle–Granger test is a two-step procedure sensitive to the choice of dependent variable, while the Phillips–Ouliaris test avoids this issue by testing the residuals from a cointegrating regression without assuming a particular dependent variable.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain what it means for a series to be integrated of order 1.</strong><br>\n",
    "  A series is integrated of order 1 if it becomes stationary after first differencing, meaning it has a unit root in levels.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the concept of cointegration.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Cointegration occurs when two or more non-stationary series share a common stochastic trend, so that a linear combination of them is stationary, indicating a long-run equilibrium relationship.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the difference between AIC and BIC information criteria.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Both AIC and BIC balance model fit with complexity, but BIC imposes a stronger penalty on model complexity and tends to select more parsimonious models, especially in large samples.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Describe the concept of unit roots in time series.</strong><br>\n",
    "  A unit root indicates a non-stationary process where shocks have permanent effects, meaning the series does not revert to a stable mean and often requires differencing to achieve stationarity.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Define an impulse response function in the context of VAR models.</strong><br>\n",
    "  An impulse response function shows how a one-time shock to one variable affects the current and future values of all variables in a VAR model, illustrating dynamic interactions over time.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the Box–Jenkins methodology.</strong><br>\n",
    "  The Box–Jenkins methodology is an iterative approach for identifying, estimating, and diagnosing ARIMA models, involving steps such as model identification, parameter estimation, and residual diagnostics.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain how cointegration differs from correlation.</strong><br>\n",
    "  Cointegration reflects a long-term equilibrium relationship among non-stationary series, while correlation only measures short-term comovement at a given point in time.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Explain the difference between a VAR model and a VECM.</strong><br>\n",
    "  A VAR model is applied to stationary data, while a VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) is used when series are cointegrated, separating short-run dynamics from long-run equilibrium adjustments.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Why might one choose a VAR model over an ADL model?</strong><br>\n",
    "  A VAR model is preferred when analyzing multiple interdependent time series, as it allows for feedback and mutual interactions among variables, unlike the single-equation ADL model.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Why is it necessary to check for stationarity in the variables before estimating a VAR model?</strong><br>\n",
    "  Stationarity ensures that relationships between variables remain stable over time. Non-stationary data can lead to spurious results, so differencing or a VECM formulation is needed if variables are cointegrated.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>How can cointegration be used in economic policy analysis?</strong><br>\n",
    "  Cointegration helps identify long-term equilibrium relationships among economic variables, guiding policymakers by revealing stable links that persist despite short-term fluctuations.</li>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "  <li><strong>How do you interpret a large positive error correction term in a VECM?</strong><br>\n",
    "  A large positive error correction term indicates a strong adjustment toward the long-run equilibrium, meaning short-term deviations are corrected rapidly.</li>\n",

    "<div style=\"background-color:lightyellow; padding:15px; border-radius:5px;\"> <h3>Interpretation of the ARCH-LM Test </h3> <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> The ARCH-LM test evaluates whether the residuals from a mean equation (in this case, an ARIMA(0,0,0) with mean) exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity—that is, whether their variance depends on past squared residuals. The test was performed using the <code>arch.test()</code> function from the <strong>aTSA</strong> package, which reports both a Portmanteau-Q test and Engle’s Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test across different lag orders. The null hypothesis is that there are no ARCH effects (homoskedastic residuals).</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> The output shows extremely small p-values (reported as 0 due to rounding) for both the Portmanteau-Q and LM statistics across all lag orders. This strongly rejects the null hypothesis, indicating the presence of ARCH effects in the residuals. In other words, the variance of <code>dmxus</code> is not constant over time, and periods of high and low volatility tend to cluster.</p> <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The presence of ARCH effects means that while the ARIMA model adequately captures the mean dynamics of <code>dmxus</code>, it fails to model the time-varying volatility. This finding suggests that extending the model to include a conditional variance component, such as a GARCH(1,1) specification, would provide a better representation of the data. The same conclusion would be supported visually if the ACF of squared residuals shows slow decay or significant autocorrelation at multiple lags—both typical signs of volatility clustering.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The ARCH-LM results confirm strong evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity. Therefore, modeling the volatility explicitly (for example, with a GARCH-type model) is necessary to improve forecast accuracy and obtain valid inference regarding uncertainty and confidence intervals.</p> </div>"
